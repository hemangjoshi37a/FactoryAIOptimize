# System Architecture

## Overview
The FactoryAIOptimize system consists of these main components:

1. **Camera Processing Module**
   - Real-time video stream analysis
   - Object detection and activity monitoring

2. **AI Analysis Engine**
   - LLM-powered insight generation
   - Process optimization suggestions
   - Cost-benefit analysis

3. **Drone Control System**
   - Autonomous inspection scheduling
   - Photogrammetry data collection

4. **Digital Twin Integration**
   - Live 3D factory model
   - Omniverse/NVIDIA integration

5. **Operator Interface**
   - REST API for system interaction
   - Web-based dashboard (future)

## Data Flow
1. Camera feeds processed frame-by-frame
2. Metadata sent to AI analysis engine
3. Insights integrated into digital twin
4. Periodic drone inspections for validation
5. Operator feedback incorporated into model
